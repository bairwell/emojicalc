This is an "EmojiCalculator" written by [Richard Bairwell](https://blog.rac.me.uk) of [Bairwell Ltd](https://www.bairwell.com).

Composer is only used in development environment for unit testing using PHPUnit 6.

At the time of writing, the code is 100% unit tested.

What is it?
-----------
This is a proof of concept/PHP technical test I took part in in the space of 4 hours in January 2017. The test involved writing a "simple web based emoji calculator" (where the operators were emoji characters). During this time, I built the entire application framework (using inspiration from my work on Slim3 projects), built the frontend and JSON interfaces (the system does use jQuery and Bootstrap, but this is the only 3rd party code) and had a fully functional system at the end of the four hour period.

Apart from jQuery/Bootstrap, all the remaining code is fully written by myself (okay, index.php isn't, and PHPStorm autogenerated some of the comments and implementor method outlines - but the "functional" code is all mine).

Since then, I've spent some time tidying up the code (bringing it up to my "own" standards), interfacing a number of classes and unit testing everything (writing the unit tests took the longest time).

Feel free to give it a spin!

Requirements
------------
Tested on PHP 7.1.

Design patterns used
---------------------
Abstract factory - Used for the Entities/Operator.

Lazy Initialization - Used in App.php under the container system.

Bridge - All major classes are designed to interface or abstracts.

Front controller - Used by index.php .

Iterator - Used in Operators.

State - Used in Router.

MVC - Used on the whole system.

There's probably quite a few other design patterns used depending on their classification.

Vagrant based startup
---------------------
The [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) install is based on [the PHP7 dev box](https://github.com/rlerdorf/php7dev) , but has been
configured to shutdown the standard nginx webserver and startup the PHP inbuilt webserver
on port 8000 and map that port to the host.

To start as a Vagrant image, just download and run:
```
vagrant up
```
Once the message
```
==> default: Ready - access http://localhost:8000/ to preview
```
appears, you can then access the files as [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

If you need to change the port number used, just up the ``Vagrantfile`` and change
the ``listening_port`` and the start before running ``vagrant up``.

Non-Vagrant startup
-------------------
Just download the files onto your machine (which already has) and run a command such as:
```
php -S localhost:8000 emojicalc/public/index.php
```
to launch the PHP inbuilt web server on the localhost only on port 8000 and serve the
files within the public/ folder.

You can then access the files as [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
